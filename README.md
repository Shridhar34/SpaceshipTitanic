Project Summary:
Spaceship titanic(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic), in the spaceship passengers were being transported to newly habitable planets but collided with an spacetime anomaly, 
The goal of the project is to analyze the data and predict which passengers were transported, using records recovered from the damaged computer systems of the Spaceship Titanic.

Key features of the project:
1) Machine Learning Model: Applied different models (logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to make prediction.
2) Feature Engineering: Applied one hot encoding to convert categorical features to numerical data, replace the missing values in the dataset

Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library for predictive modeling.
